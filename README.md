# Spring-boot-Blog-site
Your own blog-site made by spring boot and MySQL

You have to open MySQL server on your device before launching "src/main/java/com.blog.blog/BlogApplication.java"
And make sure to edit "src/main/resources/application.properties" according to your MySQL server.
It you want to use something other than MySQL(for example MongoDB), you will have to check guide on spring.io and do some changes in code.
